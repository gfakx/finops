## Project Context & Objectives

### Context:
- Large-scale migration from on-prem to Azure DevOps SaaS
- Temporary instance required during migration
- Large data volumes with cost implications
- Need for proper governance and tracking

### Objectives:
- Establish comprehensive cost tracking framework
- Ensure optimal utilization of cloud resources
- Implement effective governance policies
- Provide transparent cost reporting
- Enable data-driven optimization decisions

---

## Cost Management Areas

### 1. User Licensing
- Track renewal cycles and user agreement terms
- Optimize license allocation and spending
- Identify underutilized licenses
- Forecast future licensing needs

### 2. System Usage (Azure Pipelines)
- Monitor pipeline usage and metrics
- Track build frequencies and job minutes
- Identify cost drivers and optimization opportunities
- Implement usage policies

### 3. System Hosting (ADO On-Premises)
- Inventory hosting infrastructure components
- Track resource utilization
- Allocate costs accurately
- Plan for migration optimization

---

## Current State Assessment

### What We Know:
- Access to Cost Management Portal available
- Need to track three cost areas (licensing, usage, hosting)
- Temporary and permanent instances will coexist
- Migration is phased with timeline dependencies

### What We Need to Discover:
- Existing documentation and data sources
- Current tracking mechanisms
- Specific reporting requirements
- Team responsibilities and workflows

---

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (Weeks 1-2)
- Data collection and gap analysis
- Requirements finalization
- Access provisioning

### Phase 2: Framework Implementation (Weeks 3-6)
- Tagging strategy implementation
- Dashboard and reporting setup
- Budget configuration

### Phase 3: Optimization & Governance (Weeks 7-12)
- Process documentation
- Training and handover
- Optimization recommendations

---

## Data & Reporting Requirements

### Data Collection Needs:
- License inventory and allocation
- Pipeline usage metrics
- Infrastructure inventory
- Cost allocation mappings

### Reporting Requirements:
- Monthly cost tracking dashboards
- Variance and trend analysis
- Optimization opportunity reporting
- Executive summaries

---

## Collaboration & Access Needs

### Team Involvement Required:
- Project management team
- DevOps/Infrastructure teams
- Finance stakeholders
- Department leaders

### Access Requirements:
- Azure Cost Management Portal
- Azure DevOps administration
- Infrastructure monitoring systems
- Existing documentation repositories

---

## Proposed Timeline

| Weeks | Activities |
|-------|------------|
| 1-2 | Data collection, gap analysis |
| 3-4 | Dashboard and reporting setup |
| 5-6 | Tagging implementation |
| 7-8 | Budget and alert configuration |
| 9-10 | Documentation and process definition |
| 11-12 | Training and handover |

---

## Questions for Discussion

1. What existing documentation is available for each cost area?
2. Who are the key stakeholders for each area?
3. What specific reporting cadence is expected?
4. Are there existing policies we should align with?
5. How should we handle tracking for the temporary instance?
6. What optimization targets should we establish?

---

## Next Steps

1. Assign data collection responsibilities
2. Schedule deep-dive sessions for each cost area
3. Define initial tagging strategy
4. Request necessary system access
5. Create detailed implementation plan
6. Establish regular check-in schedule
