# Azure DevOps FinOps Kickoff Meeting
## Key Talking Points & Discussion Guide

### Introduction (2-3 minutes)
- "Thank you all for joining this important kickoff meeting for our Azure DevOps FinOps implementation."
- "As the FinOps specialist assigned to this project, my goal is to establish effective monthly cost tracking across user licensing, system usage, and infrastructure hosting."
- "Today's meeting is about understanding our current state, identifying gaps, and planning our implementation approach."

### Setting the Context (3-5 minutes)
- "The migration from on-premises to Azure DevOps represents both an opportunity and a challenge from a cost management perspective."
- "We need to establish proper tracking now, as data volumes are significant and we'll be managing both temporary and permanent instances."
- "Effective FinOps practices will help us optimize spending, improve forecasting, and ensure proper governance throughout the migration."

### Current Understanding (5 minutes)
- "Based on the initial requirements, we need to track and manage costs across three key areas:
  1. User licensing - renewal cycles and agreement terms
  2. System usage - specifically Azure Pipelines consumption
  3. System hosting - on-premises infrastructure during migration"
- "I currently have access to the Cost Management Portal, but we'll need to assess what specific data is available and what additional sources we need to tap into."
- "My preliminary approach involves leveraging existing data and identifying gaps that require additional information collection."

### Key Questions to Guide Discussion (15-20 minutes)
For each area (licensing, usage, hosting), ask:
- "Who currently manages and tracks this cost area?"
- "What tools or systems are you using to monitor these costs today?"
- "What are the biggest pain points in tracking and optimizing these costs?"
- "What level of granularity do you need in reporting for this area?"
- "Are there existing policies or governance procedures we should be aware of?"

### Implementation Approach (10 minutes)
- "I've drafted a phased implementation approach spanning approximately 12 weeks."
- "We'll start with data collection and gap analysis, then move to implementing tagging, dashboards, and reporting."
- "The final phase will focus on documentation, training, and establishing ongoing optimization processes."
- "This timeline is flexible and I'd appreciate your input on any constraints or dependencies we should consider."

### Resource Requirements Discussion (5-10 minutes)
- "To implement effective cost tracking, we'll need:
  - Access to relevant systems and data sources
  - Regular input from key stakeholders
  - Clarity on reporting expectations
  - Agreement on governance processes"
- "What resources do you think will be most challenging to secure?"
- "Are there any access limitations I should be aware of?"

### Expectations and Success Criteria (5 minutes)
- "From your perspective, what would make this FinOps implementation successful?"
- "What specific metrics or KPIs should we track to measure our effectiveness?"
- "How frequently should we provide updates and to whom?"

### Next Steps (5 minutes)
- "Based on our discussion today, I'll distribute data collection templates for each cost area."
- "I propose we schedule deeper follow-up sessions for each of the three cost areas within the next two weeks."
- "I'll also draft a detailed implementation plan based on today's input for your review."
- "What additional actions would you recommend we take following this meeting?"

### Closing (2-3 minutes)
- "Thank you for your input and engagement. Effective cost management is a team effort."
- "I'm excited to partner with you to establish these critical FinOps practices."
- "Please feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions or additional information."
- "I'll send out meeting notes and next steps by [specific date]."
