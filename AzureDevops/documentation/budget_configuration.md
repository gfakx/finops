# Azure DevOps Migration - Budget Configuration Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive budget configuration strategy for the Azure DevOps migration project. It establishes the framework for creating, managing, and monitoring budgets across different project dimensions, ensuring cost predictability and proper financial governance throughout the migration process.

## Objectives
- Establish clear budget boundaries for the migration project
- Configure appropriate alerting mechanisms to provide early warning of cost overruns
- Enable budget tracking at various organizational levels
- Support forecasting and trend analysis
- Create transparency in cost management

- **Trigger**: When forecast exceeds budget by 10%
- **Recipients**: Same as standard thresholds plus Finance Director
- **Action Required**: Forecast review meeting, potential budget adjustment

### 3. Daily Rate Alerts
- **Description**: Alerts when daily spend rate indicates potential overrun
- **Trigger**: When daily rate exceeds 5% of monthly budget
- **Recipients**: FinOps Specialist, Technical Lead
- **Action Required**: Immediate investigation of anomalous spending

### 4. Custom Alert Conditions
- **Description**: Specialized alerts for specific conditions
- **Examples**:
  - Specific service exceeds 30% of overall budget
  - New resource creation exceeds $1,000/day
  - Weekend spending exceeds weekday average

## Budget Implementation Process

### 1. Budget Creation
1. Gather baseline spend data from similar environments
2. Collaborate with technical teams for capacity planning
3. Apply appropriate buffer (typically 15-20%)
4. Document assumptions and limitations
5. Secure approval from finance and project leadership
6. Configure in Azure Cost Management

### 2. Budget Documentation
For each budget, document:
- Budget name and ID
- Total amount and time period
- Scope (subscription, resource group, tags)
- Owner and stakeholders
- Alert configuration
- Adjustment history
- Linked to business justification

### 3. Budget Adjustment Procedure
1. Document reason for adjustment request
2. Provide variance analysis
3. Secure approval from designated authority
4. Update budget in Azure Cost Management
5. Notify all stakeholders
6. Update documentation with change history

## Budget Monitoring Framework

### 1. Daily Monitoring
- **Responsible**: FinOps Specialist
- **Activities**:
  - Review previous day's spend
  - Identify anomalies and unexpected charges
  - Investigate threshold breaches
  - Document findings in daily log

### 2. Weekly Review Meetings
- **Participants**: FinOps Lead, Technical Lead, Project Manager
- **Agenda**:
  - Review week-over-week trends
  - Address any budget alerts
  - Identify optimization opportunities
  - Update forecast if needed
  - Document decisions and actions

### 3. Monthly Budget Reports
- **Recipients**: Department Heads, Project Director, Finance
- **Content**:
  - Budget vs. actual spend
  - Significant variances with explanations
  - Trend analysis and forecasting
  - Optimization recommendations
  - Risk identification

### 4. Quarterly Budget Assessment
- **Participants**: Executive Sponsors, Finance, FinOps Lead
- **Activities**:
  - Comprehensive review of all budgets
  - Adjustment of annual forecasts
  - Approval of major budget changes
  - Strategic direction for cost optimization
