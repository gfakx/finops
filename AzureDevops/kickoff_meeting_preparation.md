# Azure DevOps FinOps Kickoff Meeting Preparation

## Meeting Objectives
- Confirm scope of monthly cost tracking requirements
- Identify existing data sources and gaps
- Establish roles and responsibilities
- Define initial implementation timeline
- Agree on success metrics and deliverables

## Key Discussion Topics

### 1. User Licensing Cost Management
- **Current State Assessment**
  - What licensing models are currently in use? (Basic, Basic + Test Plans, Stakeholder, etc.)
  - How are licenses currently tracked and by whom?
  - Is there an existing renewal process? Who manages it?
  - What are the current pain points with license management?

- **Data Requirements**
  - License counts by type and assignment
  - Renewal dates and terms
  - Historical license utilization trends
  - Cost allocation to departments/projects

- **Implementation Questions**
  - Who needs access to licensing reports?
  - What is the frequency of reporting needed? (Monthly, weekly, ad-hoc)
  - Are there specific optimization targets for licensing?
  - Is there a license approval workflow we need to consider?

### 2. System Usage Tracking (Azure Pipelines)
- **Current State Assessment**
  - Current pipeline usage patterns and metrics
  - Existing monitoring in Cost Management Portal
  - Known cost drivers and inefficiencies
  - Pipeline usage distribution across teams/projects

- **Data Requirements**
  - Pipeline minutes consumed by project/team
  - Parallel job usage and allocation
  - Build agent utilization metrics
  - Peak usage times and patterns

- **Implementation Questions**
  - Are there existing pipeline usage policies?
  - Who needs visibility into pipeline cost data?
  - What level of granularity is needed for tracking?
  - Are there known optimization opportunities to validate?

### 3. System Hosting Infrastructure (ADO On-Premises)
- **Current State Assessment**
  - Current inventory of on-prem infrastructure components
  - Existing cost tracking mechanisms
  - Planned migration timeline for on-prem components
  - Current allocation/chargeback model

- **Data Requirements**
  - Complete infrastructure inventory (compute, storage, networking)
  - Resource utilization metrics
  - Associated maintenance and support costs
  - Depreciation schedules if applicable

- **Implementation Questions**
  - Who manages the on-prem infrastructure currently?
  - Is there a plan for hybrid operation during migration?
  - What existing monitoring tools are in place?
  - Who needs visibility into hosting costs?

### 4. Cost Management Tool Implementation
- **Current Access and Capabilities**
  - Current access levels to Cost Management Portal
  - Available data in the portal relevant to our needs
  - Reporting capabilities and limitations
  - Integration capabilities with other systems

- **Implementation Requirements**
  - Required custom views and dashboards
  - Alert and notification requirements
  - Export and integration needs
  - Custom tagging implementation

- **Governance Considerations**
  - RBAC requirements for cost data
  - Approval workflows for exceeding thresholds
  - Compliance requirements for cost reporting
  - Data retention policies

### 5. Temporary Instance Management
- **Instance Details**
  - Timeline for temporary instance creation and usage
  - Expected resource requirements
  - Integration with permanent infrastructure
  - Migration plan back to enterprise instance

- **Tracking Requirements**
  - Separate tracking needs for temporary instance
  - Budget allocation and monitoring
  - Special tagging requirements
  - Reporting requirements to project sponsors

## Resource Requirements
- **Access Needs**
  - Azure Cost Management Portal access
  - Azure DevOps administration access
  - On-premises infrastructure monitoring systems
  - License management systems

- **Team Involvement**
  - Project management representation
  - Infrastructure/DevOps team members
  - Finance/accounting stakeholders
  - Department leaders for chargeback discussions

## Initial Timeline Proposal
- Week 1-2: Data collection and gap analysis
- Week 3-4: Initial dashboard and reporting setup
- Week 5-6: Tagging strategy implementation
- Week 7-8: Budget and alert configuration
- Week 9-10: Documentation and process definition
- Week 11-12: Training and handover

## Success Criteria Discussion Points
- Accuracy of cost reporting (target %)
- Reporting timeliness (by X day of month)
- Budget variance thresholds
- License utilization targets
- Cost optimization goals (% reduction)

## Action Items to Propose
1. Assign data collection responsibilities
2. Schedule follow-up deep-dive sessions for each cost area
3. Define initial tagging strategy
4. Request necessary access to systems
5. Create detailed implementation timeline
6. Establish regular check-in schedule

## Questions to Address Project Team Concerns
- How will this impact team workflows?
- What is the expected time commitment from team members?
- How will cost data be used (accountability vs. punishment)?
- What training will be provided for new processes?
- How will success be measured?
