# Cloud Account Management Systems for FinOps

**Date:** April 13, 2025

## Executive Summary

This document outlines three recommended systems for managing your organization's 185 cloud accounts across AWS and Azure. These solutions address your specific need for a centralized system where any FinOps team member can view account information, track recent changes, monitor communications with project teams, and manage account lifecycle events such as decommissioning requests.

## Current Challenges

Your organization faces several account management challenges:
- **No centralized tracking** of cloud accounts and their associated project teams
- **Inefficient communication tracking** when handling requests or notifying teams of cost anomalies
- **Manual decommissioning process** requiring forms and multiple communications
- **Limited visibility** into account history and previous communications
- **Disconnected workflows** between FinOps team members

## Key Requirements for an Account Management System

Based on your needs, an ideal account management system should:

1. **Track account metadata** for all 185 AWS and Azure accounts
2. **Associate accounts with project teams** and record team contact information
3. **Document communications history** related to each account
4. **Manage lifecycle events** such as provisioning and decommissioning
5. **Support workflow automation** for common processes
6. **Provide reporting capabilities** for account status and activities
7. **Integrate with existing tools** like AWS and Azure management consoles
