# Cloud Cost Forecasting Implementation Guide

**Date:** April 13, 2025

## Executive Summary

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to transform our current reactive forecasting model into a collaborative, driver-based forecasting system with self-service capabilities. By leveraging our existing CUDOS and CID dashboards, we'll enhance our ability to predict cloud costs accurately, improve project team accountability, and enable data-driven capacity planning.

## Current Forecasting Approach

### Current Methodology
- **High-level historical comparison** between past and current spend
- **Environment-based segmentation** (ASEA, LZ, and Azure)
- **Percentage difference calculation** using simple trend analysis
- **Manual forecasting process** performed by the FinOps team
- **Ad-hoc project forecast requests** fulfilled on demand

### Limitations of Current Approach
- Limited visibility into planned workload changes and business events
- Disconnected process where project teams don't take ownership of forecasts
- Inability to incorporate business context and drivers into forecasts
- Insufficient granularity for project-level financial planning
- No mechanism for forecast accuracy tracking or improvement
- Significant manual effort required for each forecast

## Forecasting Maturity Model

| Dimension | Current State (Level 1) | Target State (Level 3) |
|-----------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Methodology** | Simple historical comparison | Driver-based forecasting with ML insights |
| **Granularity** | Environment level (ASEA, LZ, Azure) | Project, service, and resource level |
| **Frequency** | Monthly with ad-hoc requests | Daily updates with automated refreshes |
| **Time Horizon** | 1-3 months | 1-12 months with varying confidence intervals |
| **Inputs** | Historical cloud cost data | Historical costs + business metrics + planned changes |
| **Ownership** | Centralized (FinOps team only) | Distributed (Project teams with FinOps governance) |
| **Accuracy** | ~60% (measured retrospectively) | >85% with variance analysis |
| **Integration** | Manual spreadsheets | Integrated dashboards with automated alerts |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: QuickSight Forecast Foundation (1-2 months)

#### 1. Enhance CUDOS/CID Dashboards with Basic Forecasting

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Enable ML Insights in QuickSight**
   - Configure ML insights on existing dashboards
   - Enable time-series forecasting on cost trends
   - Set appropriate confidence intervals (80-95%)

2. **Create Athena View for Forecast Data**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW forecast_base AS
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', line_item_usage_start_date) AS usage_month,
    line_item_usage_account_id,
    product_service_code,
    product_region,
    SUM(line_item_unblended_cost) AS monthly_cost
FROM
    summary_view
WHERE
    line_item_usage_start_date >= DATE_ADD('month', -12, CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY
    DATE_TRUNC('month', line_item_usage_start_date),
    line_item_usage_account_id,
    product_service_code,
    product_region
ORDER BY
    usage_month;
```

3. **Implement Account-to-Project Mapping**
   - Create mapping table as described in dashboard customization guide
   - Join with forecast view to enable project-level forecasting

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW project_forecast AS
SELECT
    f.*,
    m.project_name,
    m.environment,
    m.team
FROM
    forecast_base f
JOIN
    account_project_mapping m
ON
    f.line_item_usage_account_id = m.account_id;
```

4. **Configure Forecast Visualizations in QuickSight**
   - Create line charts with forecast extensions
   - Add confidence interval bands
   - Configure monthly, quarterly and annual views
   - Add forecast variance calculated field

#### 2. Create Forecast Accuracy Tracking

        period,
        account_id,
        project_name,
        forecasted_amount
    FROM

    ON
        s.line_item_usage_account_id = m.account_id
    WHERE
        line_item_usage_start_date >= DATE_ADD('month', -12, CURRENT_DATE)
    GROUP BY
        DATE_TRUNC('month', line_item_usage_start_date),
        line_item_usage_account_id,
        m.project_name
)
SELECT
    f.forecast_date,
    f.period,
    f.account_id,
    f.project_name,
    f.forecasted_amount,
    a.actual_amount,
    (a.actual_amount - f.forecasted_amount) AS variance_amount,
    ((a.actual_amount - f.forecasted_amount) / f.forecasted_amount) * 100 AS variance_percentage,
    CASE
        WHEN ABS(((a.actual_amount - f.forecasted_amount) / f.forecasted_amount) * 100) <= 5 THEN 'Excellent'
        WHEN ABS(((a.actual_amount - f.forecasted_amount) / f.forecasted_amount) * 100) <= 10 THEN 'Good'
        WHEN ABS(((a.actual_amount - f.forecasted_amount) / f.forecasted_amount) * 100) <= 20 THEN 'Fair'
        ELSE 'Poor'
    END AS accuracy_rating
FROM
    forecast_data f
JOIN
    actual_data a
ON
    f.period = a.usage_month

### Creating Forecast-Ready Datasets

For optimal forecasting performance, ensure your datasets:
1. Have consistent time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
