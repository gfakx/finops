# FinOps Champions Framework

**Date:** April 12, 2025

## Executive Summary

This framework outlines a structured approach to establishing a network of FinOps Champions across your organization's 71 projects. By embedding FinOps representatives within each project team, you can foster a culture of cloud cost awareness, accelerate implementation of optimization recommendations, and drive accountability for cloud financial management.

## Current Challenges

Your organization currently faces several challenges that a FinOps Champions program can address:

- **Implementation Bottlenecks:** Operations teams struggle to get project team buy-in for cost optimization initiatives
- **Reactive Approach:** Cost optimization occurs reactively based on CSP recommendations rather than proactively
- **Knowledge Gaps:** Project teams lack awareness of cloud costs and optimization opportunities
- **Ineffective Communication:** Limited channels between FinOps, operations, and project teams
- **Limited Accountability:** Project teams not held responsible for cloud spending

## Example Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Reserved Instance Implementation

**Challenge:** Low adoption of Reserved Instances despite clear savings opportunity.

**Champion-led Approach:**
1. Champion translated general recommendation into specific instances for their project
2. Calculated project-specific ROI for 1-year and 3-year commitments
3. Addressed team concerns about resource flexibility
4. Coordinated implementation with operations
5. Tracked actual vs. projected savings

**Outcome:** 85% of eligible instances converted to RIs, resulting in 45% cost reduction for those resources.

### Case Study 2: Development Environment Optimization

**Challenge:** Development environments running 24/7 despite only being used during business hours.

**Champion-led Approach:**
1. Champion surveyed team for actual usage patterns
2. Proposed automatic start/stop schedule with override capability
3. Conducted two-week pilot with volunteer developers
4. Documented process for requesting exceptions
5. Implemented solution across all development environments

**Outcome:** 65% reduction in development environment costs with no impact on productivity.

## Conclusion

Implementing a FinOps Champions Framework provides a sustainable approach to embedding cloud financial management practices across your organization. By establishing a network of empowered Champions within each project team, you can accelerate the implementation of cost optimization recommendations, increase cloud cost awareness, and drive accountability for cloud financial management.

This framework transforms your current reactive model into a proactive, distributed approach to FinOps that leverages the domain expertise of project teams while providing them with the knowledge and tools to make cost-effective decisions.

## Next Steps

1. Present this framework to executive leadership for sponsorship
