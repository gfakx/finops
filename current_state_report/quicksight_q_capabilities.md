**Date:** April 13, 2025

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research into Amazon QuickSight Q capabilities and our current FinOps environment, this report outlines how activating QuickSight Q would enhance our cloud financial management practices. With our existing QuickSight implementation using CUDOS and CID dashboards, QuickSight Q offers natural language querying, AI-driven analytics, and self-service capabilities that can significantly improve our FinOps team's efficiency while democratizing cost analysis across our 185 accounts spanning AWS Landing Zone, ASEA, and Azure environments.

## Current State Assessment

Our organization currently has:
- **QuickSight Licensing**: Reader and Author users without Q capabilities
- **Dashboard Infrastructure**: CUDOS and CID dashboards for cost reporting
- **Data Architecture**: CUR data in S3 with AWS Glue and Athena for processing
- **Datasets**: summary_view, hourly_view, ec2_running_cost, s3_view, and compute_savings_plan_eligible_spend
- **Multi-Cloud Environment**: 185 accounts across AWS Landing Zone, ASEA, and Azure with plans for unified visualization

## Amazon QuickSight Q Capabilities

Amazon QuickSight Q has evolved significantly since its 2020 launch and now encompasses:

### 1. Natural Language Query (NLQ)

- Support for iterative questions and follow-up queries

### 2. AI-Powered Data Exploration
- Automatically suggest relevant visualizations based on query context
- Identify relationships between variables without manual analysis
- Generate insights from patterns that might otherwise be missed

### 3. Advanced Analytics Capabilities
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically identify unusual spending patterns
- **Forecasting**: Project future costs based on historical trends
- **What-If Analysis**: Model different spending scenarios
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify drivers behind cost changes

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Requirements
- **Topics Creation**: Define data topics for each dataset (e.g., AWS Costs, Azure Costs)
- **Field Mappings**: Ensure proper configuration of field semantics and relationships
- **Data Preparation**: Potentially enhance Athena views for optimal Q performance

### Licensing and Pricing
- **Account Enablement Fee**: $250/month per QuickSight account
- **User Pricing**: 
  - Author Pro: $18/month (annual) or $24/month (monthly) vs. current Author: $12/month
  - Reader Pro: $7/month (annual) or $9/month (monthly) vs. current Reader: $4/month
- **Alternative**: Question capacity pricing available for large-scale deployments

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 months)
- Activate Amazon Q in QuickSight
- Configure initial topics for core datasets
- Train FinOps team on capabilities
- Develop usage guidelines

#### Phase 2: Expansion (2-3 months)
