## Executive Summary

Our organization manages a substantial multi-cloud environment with 185 accounts across AWS and Azure platforms. A recent audit by DTC identified significant opportunities to enhance our cloud financial operations.

This presentation outlines our strategic plan to address the Q1 "Laying the Foundation" recommendations, focusing on four key initiatives:

1. **FinOps Champions Framework** - Embedding financial accountability within project teams
2. **Cloud Governance Framework** - Establishing policies and controls for resource management
3. **Account & Stakeholder Management** - Improving collaboration with project teams
4. **Azure-QuickSight Integration** - Enhancing data visibility across our multi-cloud environment

These initiatives directly address DTC's Q1 recommendations to capture immediate cost savings, obtain leadership buy-in, socialize updated team structures, and establish governance frameworks.
