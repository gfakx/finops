# Cloud FinOps: Current State Report

**Date:** April 12, 2025  
**Organization:** [Organization Name]  

## Executive Summary
This report documents the current state of cloud financial operations (FinOps) across the organization's multi-cloud environment. It identifies key challenges, opportunities for optimization, and recommends a structured approach to improve cloud cost management.

## Current Cloud Environment

### Account Structure
- **Total Linked Accounts:** 185
  - AWS Landing Zone: 56 accounts
  - ASEA: 108 accounts
  - Azure: 21 accounts
- **Projects:** 71 distinct projects with varying numbers of accounts based on environments (dev, prod, stage)
- **Regional Focus:** 98% of deployment in Canada Central region

### Current FinOps Tooling
- QuickSight for BI visualization
- Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data in S3
- AWS Glue and Athena for data processing
- CUDOS and CID dashboards for cost reporting
- Available QuickSight datasets:
  - summary_view
  - hourly_view
  - ec2_running_cost
  - s3_view
  - compute_savings_plan_eligible_spend

## Current Challenges

### Resource Utilization Monitoring
- **Manual monitoring process** using AWS Cost Explorer and Azure Cost Analysis
- Underutilization of CUDOS and CID dashboard capabilities
- Limited automation for resource optimization
- No systematic process for identifying idle or underutilized resources
- Customization needed for anomaly detection and advanced insights

### Budgeting Process
- **No formal budgeting process** in place across cloud environments
- Ad-hoc budget allocation using Cost Explorer
- Limited ability to track spending against budgets
- No mechanism for budget enforcement or alerting

### Reporting Challenges
- Outdated information about project team members and responsibilities
- Difficulty contacting appropriate stakeholders for cost optimization initiatives
- No dedicated CRM or contact management system for cloud resource stakeholders
- Reliance on Azure Remedy for ticket management, but insufficient for stakeholder tracking

### Cost Allocation
- **No cost allocation tags** in place across cloud environments
- Difficult to attribute costs to specific projects, teams, or business units
- Limited ability to analyze spending patterns at granular levels

### Governance
- **No formal policies** for resource provisioning
- **No governance framework** for rightsizing or reserved instance purchases
- **Reactive model** based on Cloud Service Provider (CSP) recommendations
- Implementations often delayed or abandoned due to lack of project team buy-in

### Organizational Structure
- **Centralized operations team** handling all implementations
- **Disconnected project teams** with limited involvement in cost optimization
- Operations team cannot make changes without explicit instructions from project teams
- **Limited awareness** of cloud costs among project teams
- **Legacy systems** in AWS Landing Zone with reluctance from project teams to migrate to ASEA
- **Enterprise-level relationships** with AWS and Azure, providing access to dedicated account teams

### Cost Optimization
- **Savings Plans:** Currently purchased for ASEA accounts only
  - Initial purchase: $100 per hour (no upfront payment)
  - 100% utilization since purchase
  - Coverage declined from 89% to 61% over 6 months
  - Additional $28 per hour purchased to restore coverage to ~95%
- **AWS Landing Zone:** No savings plans due to planned migration to ASEA
- **Azure:** No cost optimization measures in place
- Other recommended optimizations (GP2 to GP3 migrations, RDS purchases) hindered by lack of project team buy-in
- High potential for resource wastage across environments

### Stakeholder Engagement
- **No structured process** for stakeholder engagement
- **Limited FinOps socialization** across the organization
- Project teams not held accountable for cloud costs

## Initial Opportunities

### Dashboard Optimization
- Customization of CUDOS and CID dashboards to leverage full potential
- Development of automated Athena queries and calculated fields in QuickSight
- Implementation of anomaly detection and automated notifications
- Better utilization of existing datasets for comprehensive reporting

### Cost Allocation Tagging
- Implementation of consistent tagging strategy across all cloud platforms
- Improved visibility and accountability for cloud resources
- Enhanced ability to perform detailed cost analysis

### FinOps Champions Model
- Nomination of FinOps champions within each project team
- Direct communication channel between FinOps and project teams
- Accelerated implementation of cost-saving recommendations

### Cross-Cloud Governance
- Establishment of standardized policies for resource provisioning
- Implementation of automated rightsizing recommendations
- Development of a consistent approach to reserved capacity purchasing

## Next Steps
This report will be expanded to include detailed recommendations, implementation plans, and expected benefits from adopting a more mature FinOps practice, focusing on:

1. **Implementation guide for cost allocation tagging**
2. **Stakeholder management system** to track project team contacts and responsibilities
3. **Dashboard customization** to improve visibility and automate reporting
4. **Governance framework** to standardize cloud resource management
5. **FinOps socialization strategy** to improve organization-wide awareness
6. **Migration strategy** for legacy systems in AWS Landing Zone
