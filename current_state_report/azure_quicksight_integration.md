# Azure Cost Data Integration with AWS QuickSight

**Date:** April 13, 2025

## Current Challenge

Your organization currently faces a significant data integration challenge:
- Azure cost data is manually uploaded once per month to QuickSight
- This manual process creates delays in reporting
- Prevents real-time analysis of multi-cloud costs
- Increases risk of human error
- Limits the frequency of cross-cloud cost analysis

## Recommended Solution: Cloud Intelligence Dashboard for Azure

Based on research, the most effective solution for automating the integration of Azure cost data with AWS QuickSight is the **Cloud Intelligence Dashboard for Azure** solution developed by AWS. This solution provides an automated pipeline that:

1. Exports Azure cost data automatically on a daily basis
2. Transfers the data to AWS
3. Processes and transforms the data for analysis
4. Makes it available in QuickSight alongside your AWS cost data

## Solution Architecture

The solution uses the following components to create an automated data pipeline:

1. **Azure Cost Export:** 
   - Configures a recurring task in Azure Cost Management
   - Automatically exports daily cost data to Azure Blob Storage in CSV format

2. **Data Transfer:**
   - AWS serverless application copies data from Azure Blob Storage to Amazon S3
   - Uses Lambda, EventBridge, and SNS to orchestrate the transfer
   - Monitors Azure Blob Storage for new exports

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - AWS Glue job processes the raw data
   - Converts CSV files to Parquet format for improved query performance
   - Transforms the data (data type conversion, column creation, deduplication)
   - Extracts Azure tags into separate columns for analysis

4. **Data Analytics:**
   - Amazon Athena queries the processed data
   - Enables SQL analysis of your Azure cost data
   - Provides a unified view when combined with AWS CUR data

5. **Visualization:**
   - QuickSight SPICE engine stores the data for fast analysis
   - Pre-built dashboards provide immediate value
   - Custom visualizations can be created as needed

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Prerequisites Setup

- Azure Subscription with appropriate permissions
- Azure Blob Storage account for cost exports
- AWS account with QuickSight Enterprise edition
- IAM permissions to deploy AWS resources

### 2. Azure Configuration

1. **Set up recurring cost export in Azure:**
   - Navigate to Cost Management in Azure Portal
   - Configure a daily export of cost data
   - Select Azure Blob Storage as the destination
   - Include all required fields (especially tags)

2. **Configure Azure permissions:**
   - Create a service principal for AWS to access Azure Blob Storage
   - Assign appropriate permissions for blob data reading

### 3. AWS Deployment

1. **Deploy the solution:**
   - Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform templates from the [AWS Samples Git repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-data-pipelines-for-azure-storage)
   - Set up required parameters (Azure connection details, S3 bucket names)
   - Deploy in the same AWS region as your existing QuickSight dashboards

2. **Configure the AWS Glue job:**
   - Adjust the AWS Glue script to process your specific Azure tag structure
   - Modify data retention settings as needed (default is 6 months)
   - Test the transformation logic

### 4. QuickSight Integration

1. **Create QuickSight dataset:**
   - Connect to the Athena view of transformed Azure data
   - Configure refresh schedule (daily recommended)
   - Set up appropriate permissions

2. **Build or modify dashboards:**
   - Create new visualizations using Azure cost data
   - Integrate with existing AWS cost dashboards
   - Implement calculated fields for cross-cloud metrics

## FOCUS Standard for Multi-Cloud Cost Management

For a more standardized approach, consider implementing the **FOCUS (FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification)** standard, which provides:

- Standardized cost data format across cloud providers
- Simplified integration of multi-cloud cost data
- Common data schema for easier analysis
- Ability to extend to additional cloud providers in the future

AWS provides a specific implementation for FOCUS that builds upon the Cloud Intelligence Dashboard for Azure, enabling a unified view of both AWS and Azure costs within QuickSight.

## Implementation Considerations

### Cost Implications

- **AWS resources:** Approximately $100/month for processing 2GB of data daily
- **QuickSight Enterprise edition:** Required for advanced features
- **Azure data egress charges:** Will apply for data transferred from Azure to AWS

### Security Considerations

- Ensure secure storage of Azure credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
- Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Use appropriate IAM roles with least privilege

### Maintenance Requirements

- Monitor AWS Glue job success/failure
- Update data pipeline for any Azure cost export format changes
- Periodically review and optimize QuickSight datasets

## Alternative Approaches

While the Cloud Intelligence Dashboard for Azure is the recommended solution, alternative approaches include:

1. **Custom ETL Pipeline:**
   - Build a custom solution using Azure Functions and AWS Lambda
   - Requires more development and maintenance effort
   - Provides maximum customization

2. **Third-Party FinOps Platforms:**
   - Solutions like Cloudability, CloudHealth, or Apptio
   - Higher cost but includes additional features
   - Reduces implementation effort

3. **Power BI Integration:**
   - Use Power BI instead of QuickSight
   - Direct connection to both AWS and Azure
   - May require changing your reporting platform

## Conclusion

Implementing the Cloud Intelligence Dashboard for Azure will eliminate the need for manual uploads of Azure cost data, providing several benefits:

- **Daily data refresh** instead of monthly
- **Automated pipeline** reducing manual effort
- **Standardized data format** for consistent analysis
- **Improved data quality** by eliminating manual errors
- **Comprehensive visibility** across your multi-cloud environment
- **Enhanced reporting capabilities** with up-to-date information

## Next Steps

1. Review the [Cloud Intelligence Dashboard for Azure workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/cidforazure/en-US) for detailed implementation instructions
2. Deploy a proof of concept in a development environment
3. Test data accuracy against your current manual process
4. Develop a production implementation plan with Operations team
5. Train FinOps team on the new capabilities
