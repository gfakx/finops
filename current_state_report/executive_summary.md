## Executive Overview

This report presents a comprehensive assessment of our cloud financial operations (FinOps) across our multi-cloud environment encompassing 185 accounts spanning AWS Landing Zone, ASEA, and Azure. Our current FinOps practice operates in a primarily reactive mode, with several foundational elements missing that prevent us from optimizing our cloud investments and driving business value.

We've identified five key strategic initiatives that, when implemented, will transform our cloud financial management capabilities:

1. **FinOps Champions Network** - Embedding financial accountability within project teams
2. **Cloud Governance Framework** - Establishing policies and controls for resource management
3. **Cost Allocation Tagging** - Enabling granular visibility and chargeback capabilities
4. **Dashboard Optimization** - Enhancing data visibility and automated monitoring
5. **Account & Stakeholder Management** - Improving collaboration with project teams

These initiatives will address our current challenges of limited project team engagement, inconsistent governance, manual processes, and limited visibility across our cloud estate.

## Current State Assessment

### Cloud Environment & Structure

Our organization manages a substantial multi-cloud environment:
- **Total Linked Accounts:** 185
  - AWS Landing Zone: 56 accounts
  - ASEA: 108 accounts
  - AWS Control Plane: 21 accounts
- **Projects:** 71 distinct projects with varying numbers of accounts based on environments (dev, prod, stage)
- **Regional Focus:** 98% of deployment in Canada Central region
- **Optimization Status:**
  - ASEA: Savings Plans in place (100% utilization, ~95% coverage)
  - AWS Landing Zone: No optimization due to planned migration
  - Azure: No optimization measures in place

### Current FinOps Tooling

- QuickSight for BI visualization
- Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data in S3
- AWS Glue and Athena for data processing
- CUDOS and CID dashboards for cost reporting
- Available QuickSight datasets: summary_view, hourly_view, ec2_running_cost, s3_view, compute_savings_plan_eligible_spend

### Organizational Structure

- Centralized operations team handling all implementations
- Disconnected project teams with limited involvement in cost optimization
- Operations team cannot make changes without explicit instructions from project teams
- Limited awareness of cloud costs among project teams
- Legacy systems in AWS Landing Zone with reluctance from project teams to migrate to ASEA
- Enterprise-level relationships with AWS and Azure, providing access to dedicated account teams

## Key Challenges & Opportunities

### Challenge 1: Project Team Engagement & Ownership
- Operations teams struggle to get project team buy-in for cost optimization initiatives
- Limited visibility and understanding of cloud costs by project teams
- No accountability framework for cloud spending
- Implementation bottlenecks for cost-saving opportunities

**Opportunity:** Establish a FinOps Champions network across all 71 projects to drive accountability, accelerate implementation of optimization recommendations, and foster a cost-conscious culture.

### Challenge 2: Governance & Policy Framework
- No formal policies for resource provisioning or governance framework for cost optimization
- Reactive optimization model based on CSP recommendations
- Inconsistent practices across AWS Landing Zone, ASEA, and Azure environments
- No structured approach to reserved capacity management

**Opportunity:** Implement a Cloud Governance Framework with standardized policies for resource provisioning, cost optimization, reserved capacity management, and compliance monitoring.

### Challenge 3: Cost Visibility & Allocation
- No cost allocation tags across cloud environments
- Difficult to attribute costs to specific projects, teams, or business units
- Limited ability to analyze spending patterns at granular levels
- Missing chargeback/showback capabilities
- No process to identify and allocate shared service costs (logging, security, etc.)
- Resistance from teams to accept shared service cost responsibility

**Opportunity:** Implement a consistent tagging strategy and shared cost allocation model across all cloud platforms to enable granular cost attribution, improved accountability, and enhanced ability to perform detailed cost analysis.

### Challenge 4: Data Integration & Reporting
- Manual process for integrating Azure cost data with QuickSight
- Underutilization of CUDOS and CID dashboard capabilities
- Limited automation for resource optimization
- No systematic process for identifying idle or underutilized resources

**Opportunity:** Enhance dashboard capabilities with automated Azure data integration, anomaly detection, project-based cost attribution, and multi-cloud cost comparison.

### Challenge 5: Account Management & Communication
- No centralized tracking of cloud accounts and their associated project teams
- Inefficient communication tracking with project teams
- Manual decommissioning process
- Limited visibility into account history and previous communications

**Opportunity:** Implement a dedicated account management system to track all accounts, project team associations, communications history, and lifecycle events.

## Strategic Recommendations

- Phase 4: Program Maturity (8 weeks)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Accelerated implementation rate of cost optimization recommendations (>80%)
- Reduced time to implement (<14 days)
- Cost reduction of >15% year-over-year per project
- ROI of >5:1 (value of savings vs. program cost)

### 2. Cloud Governance Framework

Implement a structured governance approach across five pillars:
- Resource Provisioning Governance
- Cost Optimization Governance
- Reserved Capacity Governance
- Cost Allocation Governance
- Compliance and Reporting Governance

**Implementation Approach:**
- Phase 1: Foundation (2 months)
- Phase 2: Implementation (2 months)

- Budget variance Â±5%
- Cost per workload unit -15% YoY

### 3. Cost Allocation Tagging Strategy

Implement a comprehensive tagging strategy across all cloud environments:
- Core tags (Project, Environment, Application, Owner, CostCenter)
- Extended tags (BusinessUnit, Confidentiality, CreatedBy, CreatedOn, etc.)
- Automated enforcement mechanisms

**Implementation Approach:**
- Phase 1: Preparation (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Existing Resources (4 weeks)
- Phase 3: New Resources (4 weeks)
- Phase 4: Validation and Optimization (4 weeks)

**Expected Outcomes:**
