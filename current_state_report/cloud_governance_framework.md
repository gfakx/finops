# Cloud Financial Governance Framework

**Date:** April 12, 2025

## Executive Summary

This Cloud Financial Governance Framework establishes structured policies, processes, and controls to optimize cloud spending across your multi-cloud environment. By implementing this framework, your organization will transition from a reactive to a proactive approach to cloud financial management, ensuring consistent application of cost optimization practices across all 71 projects and 185 accounts.

## Current Governance Gaps

Your organization currently faces several governance challenges:

- **No formal policies** for resource provisioning
- **No governance framework** for rightsizing or reserved instance purchases
- **Reactive optimization model** based on CSP recommendations
- **Implementation bottlenecks** due to lack of project team buy-in
- **Inconsistent practices** across AWS Landing Zone, ASEA, and Azure environments

## Governance Framework Overview

This framework is structured around five core pillars of cloud financial governance:

1. **Resource Provisioning Governance**
2. **Cost Optimization Governance**
3. **Reserved Capacity Governance**
4. **Cost Allocation Governance**
