## Page 3: Executive Summary

Our FinOps practice faces challenges in cost visibility, accountability, and governance across our 185+ cloud accounts. A recent DTC audit confirmed these issues and provided a phased roadmap for maturity. This presentation focuses on **Q1: Laying the Foundation**. We propose four key initiatives: implementing a **FinOps Champions Framework**, establishing a robust **Cloud Governance Framework**, enhancing **Account & Stakeholder Management**, and leveraging **Azure QuickSight Integration** for better visibility. These actions directly address DTC's Q1 recommendations to capture savings, secure leadership buy-in, socialize team structure, and establish governance. Successful execution will build a solid foundation for scalable and efficient cloud financial management, driving immediate value and preparing us for future optimization.

**Proposed Solution:**
*   Implement a structured Cloud Governance Framework encompassing:
    *   **Tagging Policy:** Mandatory tags for cost allocation, environment, owner, etc.
    *   **Account Baseline Configurations:** Standard security and cost settings for new accounts.
    *   **Cost Anomaly Detection Processes:** Defined procedures for identification and remediation.
    *   **Right-sizing Guidelines:** Processes for regular review and optimization of resources.
    *   **Automation Strategy:** Phased plan to automate enforcement (e.g., tagging compliance checks, automated shutdowns for non-compliance).

**Benefits:**
*   **Consistency & Standardization:** Ensures uniform application of policies.
*   **Risk Reduction:** Proactively mitigates cost overruns and security vulnerabilities.
*   **Efficiency:** Reduces manual effort through standardization and future automation.
*   **Foundation for Optimization:** Creates the necessary structure for effective cost management.

**Alignment with DTC Q1:**
*   **Establish Governance Framework:** Directly implements this core recommendation.
*   **Capture Immediate Cost Savings:** Enables identification of non-compliance and waste (e.g., untagged resources, over-provisioning).
