# AI Agentic Workflows for Cloud FinOps

**Date:** April 13, 2025

## Executive Summary

This report outlines how AI agentic workflows can enhance our existing FinOps infrastructure to transform cost management from a reactive, manual process to an autonomous, intelligent system. By extending our current architecture of CUR data in S3, AWS Glue, Athena, and QuickSight, AI agents can deliver significant improvements in cost optimization, anomaly detection, forecasting accuracy, and process automation across our multi-cloud environment.

## Current State Assessment

Our organization has established foundational FinOps capabilities including:

- **Data Architecture**: CUR data stored in S3 with AWS Glue and Athena for processing
- **Visualization**: QuickSight dashboards (CUDOS and CID) for reporting
- **Multi-Cloud Strategy**: Plans to integrate Azure data with QuickSight
- **Process Challenges**: Manual optimization, reactive monitoring, and limited forecasting capabilities
- **Optimization Status**: Varying levels of optimization across ASEA, AWS Landing Zone, and Azure

While this foundation provides visibility, it remains largely manual, requiring significant human intervention to identify and implement cost optimizations. This creates bottlenecks, especially as we scale to 185 accounts across multiple cloud platforms.

## AI Agentic Workflows: The Next Evolution of FinOps

AI agentic workflows represent the latest evolution in cloud financial management, using artificial intelligence to create autonomous systems that can:

1. **Continuously monitor** cloud resources and spending
2. **Automatically detect** anomalies and optimization opportunities
3. **Make intelligent decisions** for cost optimization
4. **Execute remediation actions** with appropriate approvals
5. **Learn from outcomes** to improve future decisions

### Key Capabilities of AI FinOps Agents
