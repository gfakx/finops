# Cost Allocation Tagging Implementation Guide

**Date:** April 12, 2025  

## Executive Summary

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to implementing cost allocation tagging across your multi-cloud environment (AWS and Azure). Effective tagging strategies allow for granular cost attribution, enhanced visibility, and improved accountability across your 71 projects and 185 accounts.

## Benefits of Implementing Cost Allocation Tags

### Financial Benefits
- **Accurate Cost Attribution:** Assign costs to specific projects, teams, and environments
- **Budget Tracking:** Monitor spending against established budgets
- **Chargeback/Showback:** Enable accurate internal billing and cost visibility
- **Cost Anomaly Detection:** Quickly identify unexpected spending patterns

### Operational Benefits
- **Resource Management:** Easily identify resources by purpose, owner, and environment
- **Compliance:** Ensure resources adhere to organizational standards
- **Lifecycle Management:** Identify unused or deprecated resources
- **Security Classification:** Tag resources based on data sensitivity or compliance requirements

## Current State Assessment

Your organization currently lacks a formalized tagging strategy across your 185 linked accounts:
- No cost allocation tags in AWS Landing Zone (56 accounts)
- No cost allocation tags in ASEA (108 accounts)
- No cost allocation tags in Azure (21 accounts)

This gap leads to:
- Difficulty attributing costs to specific projects or teams
- Challenges with identifying optimization opportunities
- Limited ability to forecast spending accurately
- Ineffective governance of cloud resources

## Recommended Tagging Strategy

### Core Tags (Required for All Resources)

| Tag Key | Description | Example Values | Platform |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Project | The project associated with the resource | project-a, project-b | AWS, Azure |
| Environment | The deployment environment | dev, test, prod, stage | AWS, Azure |
| Application | The application using the resource | app-name | AWS, Azure |
| Owner | Email or identifier of resource owner | team-a@company.com | AWS, Azure |
| CostCenter | Financial cost center code | cc-123456 | AWS, Azure |

### Extended Tags (Recommended for Better Granularity)

| Tag Key | Description | Example Values | Platform |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| BusinessUnit | Organizational business unit | finance, marketing, it | AWS, Azure |
| Confidentiality | Data sensitivity level | public, internal, confidential | AWS, Azure |
| CreatedBy | Person who created the resource | user-id | AWS, Azure |
| CreatedOn | Resource creation date | YYYY-MM-DD | AWS, Azure |
| Backup | Backup requirements | daily, weekly, none | AWS, Azure |
| EndDate | Resource retirement date | YYYY-MM-DD | AWS, Azure |

## Technical Implementation Details

### AWS Implementation

#### Activating Cost Allocation Tags

1. Log into the AWS Management Console with appropriate permissions
2. Navigate to Billing Dashboard > Cost Allocation Tags
3. Select the user-defined tags you want to activate
4. Click "Activate"
5. Note: Tags will only appear in billing reports after activation (data is not retroactive)

#### Tag Policy Example (AWS Organizations)

```json
{
  "tags": {
    "Project": {
      "tag_key": {
        "@@assign": "Project"
      },
      "tag_value": {
        "@@assign": [
          "project-a",
          "project-b",
          "project-c"
        ]
      },
      "enforced_for": {
        "@@assign": [
          "ec2:instance",
          "s3:bucket"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### AWS CLI Commands for Tag Management

Bulk tagging resources:
```bash
aws resourcegroupstaggingapi tag-resources --resource-arn-list [ARN1,ARN2] --tags Project=ProjectName,Environment=Production
```

Finding untagged resources:
```bash
aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources --tag-filters Key=Project,Values=[] --resource-type-filters ec2
```

### Azure Implementation

#### Azure Policy for Tag Inheritance

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "displayName": "Inherit a tag from the resource group",
    "description": "Adds the specified tag with its value from the parent resource group when any resource is created or updated.",
    "parameters": {
      "tagName": {
        "type": "String",
        "metadata": {
          "displayName": "Tag Name",
          "description": "Name of the tag, such as 'Project'"
        }
      }
    },
    "policyRule": {
      "if": {
        "allOf": [
          {
            "field": "[concat('tags[', parameters('tagName'), ']')]",
            "exists": "false"
          }
        ]
      },
      "then": {
        "effect": "modify",
        "details": {
          "operations": [
            {
              "operation": "add",
              "field": "[concat('tags[', parameters('tagName'), ']')]",
              "value": "[resourceGroup().tags[parameters('tagName')]]"
            }
          ],
          "roleDefinitionIds": [
            "/providers/microsoft.authorization/roleDefinitions/b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Azure CLI Commands for Tag Management

Adding tags to a resource group:
```bash
az group update --name MyResourceGroup --tags Project=ProjectName Environment=Production
```

Adding tags to all VMs in a resource group:
```bash
az vm update --ids $(az vm list --resource-group MyResourceGroup --query "[].id" -o tsv) --set tags.Project=ProjectName tags.Environment=Production
```

## Monitoring and Compliance
